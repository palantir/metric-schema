fix:
  description: Instead of setting sourceDirs and generatedSourceDirs to be an ImmutableSet,
    retrieve the existing respective sets and add to them. This is the commonly accepted
    method of appending sourceDirs and generatedSourceDirs, and keeps each set mutable
    to avoid breaking other plugins.
