    Generated utilities use TaggedMetricRegistry.registerWithReplacement

    This prevents non-obvious resource leaks where attmpts to
    re-register gauges are silently ignored while the registry holds
    a reference to the original gauge.

    The `registerWithReplacement` api was added in Tritium `0.16.1`, a dependency
    upgrade may be required for generated code to compile.
