  description: Generated code now includes a libraryName and libraryVersion tag in
    all metrics, to help attribute fleet wide cost to particular libraries. This uses
    a libraryName derived from the gradle `rootProject.name` by default, although
    this can be overridden on the `generateMetricSchema` task if desired. (Setting
    it to `null` turns off the tag entirely).
